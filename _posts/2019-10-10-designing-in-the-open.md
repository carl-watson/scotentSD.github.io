## What does design in the open mean?

According to Brad Frost, [designing in the open](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designing-in-the-open/) means

>sharing your work and/or process publicly as you undertake a design project

It's not about making your code open source (although it could include that). It's about:
- Sharing bits of things as you build them
- Sharing versions of things as they eveolve and change
- Sharing techniques and resources
- Sharing our experiences and stories

For us, designing in the open means sharing all the documents and artefacts and prototypes an anything else we generate publicly by default.

Unless there is a good reason not to - for example, if it contains personal or potentially sensitive information - we make it as widely available as we can as soon as possible. Often, that means our work is available while we are still working on it.

## Why design in the open?

Well, we're a public body, so why shouldn't the ouputs of our work be available to the people who fund it?

But the process brings many benefits:
â€“ Faster feedback
- Feedback from a wider group
- Generating buy-in from the community and stakeholders
- Demonstrating our commitment (and work in progress)
- Communicating all day, every day
- Reduce the cost of communication within the team, even if some work remotely

But mostly, it's just about being open, honest, and transparent. And we reduce our communication overhead because we don't need to tell people about what we've done if it is right in front of them any time they want it.
