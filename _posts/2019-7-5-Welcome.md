# Design in the open

1. The idea of this site is to foster a culture, of designing in open and transparent collaboration, with partners and customers.  

2. We also want to share how we work and hope that this helps others with their projects.

3. At the same time we are super keen to hear where we could improve. It's a two way street :-)
