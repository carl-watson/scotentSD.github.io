This is the home of Service Design in Scottish Enterprise.

It is here to make us more transparent and to help the sharing of information, practice and learning.

We are keen to share how and what we are doing. Copy what you want and tell us if you know better ways of doing stuff :-)

<div>
There are areas for various Workstreams which will deep dive into their Research & Design.

<div>
There is also a [Blog](https://scotentSD.github.io/blog/) that will cover a lot of the ongoing learning
