This is the home of Service Design in Scottish Enterprise.

It is here to make us more transparent and to help the sharing of information, practice and learning.

<div>
We are keen to share how and what we are doing. Copy what you want and tell us if you know better ways of doing stuff :-)
</div>

<div>
There are areas for various Workstreams which will deep dive into their Research & Design.

<div>
There is also a [Blog](https://scotentSD.github.io/blog/) that will cover a lot of the ongoing learning
