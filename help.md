## Blog
The Blog page has code to display any posts in the **posts** folder. The default layout is in the **Layout** folder: post.html

![Design in the open](/images/blogpost-code.PNG)


## Creating a Blog post
Create a markup file in the posts folder and name it in the format :

**yyyy-mm-dd-title.md**

This date will be used to create the line at the bottom of your post:

Written on dd mmm, yyyy

At the top of your file, add the following lines:  

```
---
layout: post
title: Welcome to this new blog
author: # (this is optional)
tags:  # to discuss, optional as a list:  ['a11y', 'communication', 'pattern'] for example  
published:  # if you don't want it to be displayed yet, then the value should be false - otherwise put true or ommit the line all together
---
```


This will give the correct layout for your post, and use that title for the blog post itself and for it to be listed with the other blog post on the main blog page.

If an excerpt marker is defined in the `\_config.yml` file then you can mark a section of the post as the excerpt. 
Everything above the  `<!—more—> `code will be the summary we can see on the main blog page. Anything below can only be seen if you click on the blog post link.

```
<!--more--> 
```

Add this line to the `_config.yml` to enable the excerpt marker:

``` 
excerpt_separator: "<!--more-->" 
```
## CSS and default layout
**`default.html` files** in various repositories all points to the CSS generated by the SASS file in scotentSD.github.io > sass > jekyll-theme-slate.scss

In the html template, the link is:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="https://scotentsd.github.io/assets/css/style.css">`

## Project timeline
**`post.html` files** in project repositories all points to the CSS file  called `timeline.css` in the **Resource repository** 

In the post.html template, the link is:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="https://scotentsd.github.io/assets/css/style.css">`

This is different for the blog posts from the navigation menu. The css for them is the same as the rest of the website, so any change have to be done in the SASS file used by all the default.html files. (see just above)

## Posts for the project timelines

### How to create a new post for the timeline

1. open the file 2019-01-01-template.md in the draft or templates folder
2. edit
3. select all : ctrl+A , and copy Ctrl+C
4. go to the **_posts** folder and **create a new file** there
5. this file should be named with the same structure as the template, but also adding the reverse date after the name: **yyyy-mm-dd-name-dd-mm-yyyy.md** (don't forget the .md!) The first reverse date will be driving the post order in the timeline, the second date after the date, make the name unique and will be used in the url to the post when cliked on.
*To create the name of the file: type the name of the file in the rectangle above the edit area it should say the-repo-name/_posts/ then the rectangle input box*
6. paste the content of the template ctrl+V
7. make your changes
8. save by commiting your file, enter your initials, and a short commit message

### How to use the template

1. do not edit the layout, it should be **layout: post** 
2. edit the **title** to what you want it to be
3. **type** will change the colour background of your title: pick one between: **lab, online, a11y, other, partner**
4. edit the **phase**: discovery, alpha, beta, live
5. put your **initials**
6. add the **date**. Format is: number in digits plus th, st, nd or rd Month in letters, and year
7. **optional** add a url to go back to the timeline page using "" around it or leave blank if not needed
8. **optional** add the **type_of_event** if you want it displayed added to the heading when the post is clicked on (Lab Testing, Partner co-creation and co-design, Accessibility, Online research and testing, Events, F2F and testing) or leave empty if not needed
9. fill in the text of your post
10. any files you want to link to should be uploaded before in the folder **files**. 
11. to link a file, **`[name of your file to display (type of file)](../files/name-of-your-file.extenstion)`**

Remember to mention what type of file it is in the text link. For example: 

`[Partner Prioritisation Spreadsheet (Excel file)](../files/SEP-Partner-Prioritisation-020819-V1.xlsx)`


## HTLM Changes to the Header and footer -  Includes 
If you want to change elements in the footer or header, you will have to do it in various `default.html` files, there is one in the `layout` folders of each repo:

- scotentSD.github.io
- resources
- posters
- personas
- practice
- sep
- international
- feedback

You might have to change the `post.html` files as well in these folders.

Part of the code can also be in the folder `includes`. At the moment, you will find:
- `meta.html` (this is all the meta tags in the header)
- `analytics.html` (this is for google analytics and is at the bottom of the body)
- `nav.html` (this is the menu in the header (Home, Blog, About Help)
- the project repo also have a `key.html` (the code for the colour key)

## Looking for a template?
Check the `Resources` repository first (the generic ones are there) or folders named **templates** or **drafts** in other repositories

## Structure (on the 24/12/19)
