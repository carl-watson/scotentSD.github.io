Our files and code to make the website are here: [https://github.com/scotentSD](https://github.com/scotentSD)
You don’t need to know how to code or use html /CSS.

The only thing you need is [**Mark Down**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and to understand the **basic of using Github**

## Understanding the structures of our repositories
### What's a repository?
### What's a commit message
Whenever you upload or delete a file,  make a change to an existing file or create a file in github, then you need to write a “commit” message.  This is a way for us to track what has been done. 

The form should be: `your initials + short explanation of what you did`

(more to add)

## Change an existing file
